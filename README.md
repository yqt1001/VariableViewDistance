# VariableViewDistance

Simple plugin that pulls ticks per second data from the server and then changes the server render distance for optimized performance. made specifically for usage on my SMP server which was having terrible tps issues with significant players online.

Uses reflections but currently limited to servers running 1.8_R3 and 1_9_R1.
